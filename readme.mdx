## Overview
Git is a version control tool that helps keep track of written code history and management as well as
coordinate work between multiple people writing into the same code base

<br/>

Quick Terminology (will go into further depth later):
- Branch: Independent copy of the repository/project. Changes do not affect other active copies.
- Commit: A summary of saved changes within the project, packaged as a single instance
- Pull Request: An operation to submit changes from the copy back into the main

Simple Flow:

*note: master branches are now referred to as main branches

# Git vs Github
Whereas Git is the tool which does bulk of the work, Github is the online interface that helps you
visualize all the operations you are performing and even perform them for you in some cases. It also
stores the repository online so your work is no longer just local to your computer hard drive
 
---

## What is Git?
 
Git is a CLI (command line interface) program used primarily within a terminal. i.e.
 
- Mac/Linux built in terminal
 
- Windows options via [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)
 
You might've heard of commands such as `ls`, `echo`, or `pwd` that list your current directory, it's contents, and such
 
---

**Usage Examples**
```
git checkout <branch name>
git add <file>
git commit -m "<commit message>"
```
Format is usually `<program name> <command> <options>`
 
In this case, `git add <file>`

# Walkthrough Lab
 
## Cloning

**Explanation**

Cloning a repository refers to downloading a copy of the main branch onto your hard drive.
Changes you make to that code won't reflect the online copy until those changes are "committed" and "pushed".

The git file or file source link is needed to clone it. Github itself offers a multitude of ways to clone a repo, which you can find with the green `Code` button at the top right of the github repo page:

<br/>

![](images/github_clone.png)

- HTTPS
- SSH
- GitHub CLI
- GitHub Desktop
- Download ZIP

**Objective**
 
- Get a local workable copy of the repo

Command: `git clone <link to .git file>`

Note: 
* Preferably you should organize your projects and clone into some sort of documents/tutorials directory
* Not every file will be dumped into where you run the command, but the contents of the copy will be put into another folder with the project name as its title
  * i.e. cloning this repo into `~/Documents` won't create `~/Documents/README.md`, `~/Documents/<all your files>`, etc but rather `Documents/github-bootcamp/<all your files>`

## Saving and Committing Changes
 
**Explanation**
A change in git is defined as creating/removing/updating/deleting a file or a line of code. It could be as simple as adding a new line in a `README.md` file.
A commit in git is defined as an atomic piece of work that could contain one or multiple changes in it. 

Commands:
```sh
git add <file_name>
git commit -m "<commit message>"
```

## Pushing up your changes
 
When you have your commits ready on your local branch, it's time to have those very changes be reflected and updated on github via a "push".
Afterwards your changes are saved in the cloud and can be viewed out by whoever else has access to that project, as well as working as a backup
in case your computer goes wacko.

Via terminal:
- `git push`
- If your branch is brand new, git may tell you to run `git push --set-upstream origin <branch name>` of which you only need copy paste and re-run

Objective
- Push your branch commits to GitHub
- View your branch on github and view its commits
- Click a commit number to see the changes under it

Visual:

Above the listed files, GitHub will show the most recent commit to that branch, the author of said commit, the commit number,
the time committed, and the total amount of commits. Clicking on that total number will show you a history and will let you
examine each commit and its packaged/summarized changes
